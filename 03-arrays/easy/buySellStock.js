//? approah:
//? 1. Initialize maxProfit to 0 and min to the first element of the array.
//? 2. Iterate through the array.
//? 3. For each element, check if the profit (current price - min) is greater than maxProfit.
//? 4. If it is, update maxProfit.
//? 5. If the current price is less than min, update min to the current price.
